yubinotes
=========

Open source secure notes app for Android that supports using either a password or the YubiKey NEO to encrypt/decrypt notes. Encryption/Decryption is based on a simple lock system that stores and wipes necessary keys for decryption. 

Who's it for?
======
Anyone who value their privacy and wish to store sensitive notes and snippets on their device. 

Who's it not for?
=====
The app will not stop ninjas with physical access to your device and your yubikey or password from extracting your notes. Also, if you're being hunted by security agencies, dont blame me if they break the crypto and steal your notes.
